# price_transmission_modeling
In this paper, I use a publicly available food commodity prices at select Ethiopian markets from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) to explore price transmission and market integration in Ethiopia.  This study primarily follows the work of Nicholas Minot and his paper on the “Transmission of World Food Price Changes to Market” (Minot 2010). We rely on a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to explore the link between Domestic prices for given commodities in Ethiopia. The VECM will test two markets at a time, allowing us to understand (1) the long-run elasticity of one market’s price with respect to the other market’s price, (2) the speed of adjustment, and (3) the short-run elasticity of one price with respect to the other.
